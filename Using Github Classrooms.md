# Using Github Classroom to set up your Team Story Assignments Repository

[Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) allows teachers to create individual assignments and group assignments that can be given to teams of students, to work on them in private or public repositories (in our case: private).

In this short guide I show you how to set up the team repository. In less than five minutes you will have a private repository for your team's analyses, data, and assembled report.

## 1. Get the team repository link and sign in Github

You will receive a link (something like `http://classroom.github.com/group-assignment-invitations/something`) in an email from your instructor to create your team repository. After you click on the link, the Github page will ask you to sign up for an account or sign in to your existing account.

## 2. Create your team

The next screen will ask you to accept the assignment.

The group project co-ordinator should create a new team by adding a team name (e.g. Team A - datasuperstars) and click on +Create team.

If you see that other teams show up in this screen, check if one of those includes your team members. That means she/he already created the team and click on it to join the team. If not, donÂ´t pay attention to them. Those are the repositories that other class teams have created already.

## 4. Get cracking! Work on your team repository now  :fist: :pencil:

Welcome to your team repository for the Autumn Summative. If your teammate is not yet in the repository you can add them or tell them to join by clicking on the link sent by the instructor and choosing your team.

In this repository you will write your Covid-19 report - it contains the data you need, each team member should work on their own R script to generate a data visual, these will be imported into one .Rmd document which knits to produce a .pdf report informing local public health and medical professionals about important issues in the Covid-19 pandemic.

Your instructors will be added automatically to the repository and will be able to watch your assignment progress.
